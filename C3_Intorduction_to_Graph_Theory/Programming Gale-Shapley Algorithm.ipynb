As an example, the man number i likes the best the woman number menPreferences[i][0], and likes the least the woman number menPreferences[i][n-1]. Similarly, the array womenPreferences contains rankings of men by women. For example, womenPreferences[i][0] is the number of man who is the top choice for woman i.\n",
